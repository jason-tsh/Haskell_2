-- In this language we use dynamic & weak typying,
-- which means varaibles can be reassigned as different types &
-- implicit casting is employed in different part of this language.

-- Examples:
a = "1" -- String
a = "" -- also String
a = 1 -- Integer
a = 1.0 -- Float form of '1', if you want
a = 1.1 -- Float

print "Value of 'a': " ++ a -- valid as implicit casting is taken place
print "Value of 'a': " ++ toStr(a) -- valid although being redundant
print "Value of 'a': " ++ toNum(a) -- also valid via implicit casting although logically incorrect
